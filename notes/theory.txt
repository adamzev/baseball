                     Basic Theory of Operation


HITTING vs PITCHING - the first step:

A hitter can do one of six things in SBS. He can:

  1) Make an out.
  2) Get a walk.
  3) Get a single.
  4) Get a double.
  5) Get a triple.
  6) Get a Home Run.

(He could also get on base on an error but that is really a subset
of making an out as far as the stats are concerned). SBS calculates
from the hitter's record the probability of each occurrence.
Then the pitcher's record is considered which modifies the probabilities.
This will be demonstrated by working through an example. Consider
the batter named Joe Hitter:

             AB Hits  2B  3B  HR  BB   K  AVG
Joe Hitter  482  147  20   4  12  41  71 .305

Compute PA (Plate Appearances) = AB + BB = 523
  (ignore sacrifice hits and Hit-By-Pitched-Balls which would make PA a
  little larger)
Compute HBB (probability of Walk) = BB / PA                      = .0784
Compute H1 (probability of single) = (Hits - (2B + 3B + HR))/ PA = .2122
Compute H2 (probability of double) = 2B / PA                     = .0382
Compute H3 (probability of triple) = 3B / PA                     = .0076
Compute H4 (probability of HR) = HR / PA                         = .0229
                                                                 -------
                                                                   .3593

**(These values of H1 thru H4 may be further adjusted for "normalization".
See discussion below). What's left is the probability of making an out
(or possibly getting on on an error): 1.0 - .3593 = .6407

We have determined Joe's probabilities as a whole against all the
pitchers he faced that particular season. But now we have to calculate
probabilities given a particular pitcher. Consider a player named
Jack Pitcher:

                IP Hits   HR  BB   K
Jack Pitcher   200  210   15  50  80

If a pitcher threw 200 innings we know he got approximately 600
batters out. The ones he did not get out got hits or walks or reached
on errors.

Compute BF (batters faced) = (IP x 3) + Hits + BB
<given>

A pitcher will face a few less batters than this due to double plays
and runners getting thrown out on the bases. On the other hand he
sometimes faces extra hitters because of defensive errors. These two
factors just about cancel each other out so we can leave the BF
equation alone for purposes of explanation.
                       
We now need to compute the probabilities for the pitcher for the same
events that we just calculated for the batter.

Compute BF (batters faced) = (IP x 3) + Hits + BB = 860

Compute P4 (probability of HR)     =  HR / BF                   = .0174
Compute P3 (probability of triple) =  Hits x .024 / BF          = .0059
Compute P2 (probability of double) =  Hits x .174 / BF          = .0425
Compute P1 (probability of single) =  (Hits / BF)- P4 - P3 - P2 = .1784
Compute PBB (probability of Walk)  =  BB / BF                   = .0581

The data usually just gives us the total hits and HR's a pitcher allowed.
However, we can use the multipliers .174 and .024 to estimate doubles
and triples from the total number of hits. These multipliers are not
constants but we figure them for each year/league from data in the
BASEBALL.CFG file.

Comparing the percentages we obtained from the hitter with the pitcher
we have come up with the following:

Event       Hitter       Pitcher
------      ------       -------
walk         7.72%         5.81%
single      20.90%        17.84%
double       3.77%         4.25%
triple       0.75%         0.59%
home run     2.26%         1.74%
out         64.60%        70.10%

At first glance it might seem that all we need to do now is average
the hitters and pitchers events like this:

single = (20.9% + 17.84%) / 2 = 19.37%
etc. for the rest of the events

This method is unacceptable, however, because it over-penalizes
the outstanding players while boosting the poorer players. That is,
it tends to lump everyone together too much. In our example above we
have a good hitter, (.305 vs the league) against what we're calling
an average pitcher. Certainly we could not expect his single% to DROP
to 19.21% from 20.90%! After all if this is an average pitcher we would
expect our batter to do at least as well against him as he did against
the rest of the league!

The solution is to use "league averages" for the events and to compare
our pitcher's performance against the league averages. For example,
we can pick up a baseball statistics magazine containing the statistics
from the preceding year, and calculate the total "batter's faced"
for all the pitchers for the entire season. We can also total the number
of walks, hits, and home runs -- and estimate using our multipliers above
-- the total number of singles, doubles, and triples. Then we can
calculate our "league averages".

For example, we find that for an entire season there was 17,500 innings
pitched, 16,500 hits, 2900 doubles, 410 triples, 1450 Home Runs,
6,300 walks.


Calculate League Averages:

  League Avg. BF = (17,500 x 3) + 16,500 + 6,300 = 75,300

   " " " "    LABB     =         6,300 / 75,300 = .0837
   " " " "    LA1      =        11,740 / 75,300 = .1559
   " " " "    LA2      =         2,900 / 75,300 = .0385
   " " " "    LA3      =           410 / 75,300 = .0054
   " " " "    LA4      =         1,450 / 75,300 = .0193

Finally we can combine our hitter percentages with our pitcher percentages
to get meaningful probabilities:

Combined percentages:
walk%     = HBB x (PBB / LABB)  = .0536  (*)
single%   = H1  x (P1  / LA1)   = .2428
double%   = H2  x (P2  / LA2)   = .0465
triple%   = H3  x (P3  / LA3)   = .0076
home run% = H4  x (P4  / LA4)   = .0204

Note that if the pitcher's percentages are nearly equal to the League
Averages, the second factor becomes essentially 1 and the hitter performs
as expected. But if the pitcher's percentages are substantially better
(lower) than the League Averages, the second factor will be less than 1
and the hitter will suffer. The reverse is true if the pitcher's percentages
are worse (larger) than the League Averages.

(*) OK, this is not quite how I do it now. I now use a slightly more
accurate (supposedly) but more complicated formula using league averages
which can be found at:

This is an article by Dan Levitt who gives credit to Bill James and
Dallas Adams:

Bill James in his 1983 Baseball Abstract introduces the log5 method for
addressing this calculation. He credits the formula below for evaluating
the batter/pitcher match-up to Dallas Adams.

Where PitAvg equals batting average against the pitcher.
We would do this for each stat calculated above. So for the likelihood of
a SINGLE, instead of getting .2428 like we did above, we would do this:

                 (.2122 x .1784) / .1559
----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
(.2122 x .1784) / .1559  +  ( (1 - .2122) x  (1 - .1784) / (1 - .1559) )

which evaluates to .2405. Not a huge difference from the simplier calculation
to get .2428.
	 


CROSS-ERA NORMALIZATION:

If normalization is enabled we modify the values of H1, H2, H3 AND H4 and
the values of P1, P2, P3 and P4 before entering them into the log5 formula
above. This allows "dead-ball" era batters to be more "offensive" when
facing modern era pitchers. Modern era batters will have more trouble
hitting the "dead-ball" era pitchers.

By default, SBS normalizes to the home team's year and league. So the
visiting team's batters are adjusted as to how their stats might stack up
in the home team's era. Likewise the visiting team's pitchers are adjusted
as to how their stats would look in the home team's era. The measuring
stick used for this is called the Linear Weights method. A "linear weight"
is calculated for the individual batter and pitcher and the league averages.
See Appendix D in BASEBALL.DOC for more details.

Other adjustments such as park effects, righty-lefty effects and pitcher
fatigue are also discussed.
